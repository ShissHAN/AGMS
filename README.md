# Run
(1 and 4 Using the PyTorch environment)
(2 and 3 Using the TensorFlow environment)
1. Run get_bg.py clustering to get initial background samples.
2. Generate target samples
2.1 Run PCA_bg.py to get the same number of background downscaled samples as the target prior.
2.2 Run GAN_target_AV.py to get the target generation samples.
3. Generate background samples
3.1 Run PCA.py to get the target sample dimensionality reduction.
3.2 Run GAN_bg.py to get the background generation samples.
4. Run train.py to train the multi-scale convolutional Siamese network using the generated samples and perform target detection.
